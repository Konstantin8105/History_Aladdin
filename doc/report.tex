\vspace{0.15 in}
\noindent\hspace{0.5 in}
This report describes Version 1.0 of ALADDIN,
an interactive computational toolkit for the matrix
and finite element analysis of engineering systems.
The ALADDIN package is designed around a language specification,
that includes quantities with physical units,
branching constructs, and looping constructs.
The basic language functionality is enhanced with 
external libraries of matrix and finite element functions.

\vspace{0.15 in}
\noindent\hspace{0.5 in}
ALADDIN's problem solving capabilities are demonstrated via the
solution to a series of matrix and numerical analysis problems.
ALADDIN is employed in the finite element analysis of two building structures,
and two highway bridge structures.
